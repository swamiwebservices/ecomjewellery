The customer felt that just clicking on the patient name in the list was not enough, it might be better to allow them to either click on a biometric icon or the whole list card. Let me know what is easiest.
Change MRN to P-MRN

The expanded screen does not have an indicator of what biometric reading it is. Can you add the icon and Label.
